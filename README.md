#House Prediction App

The idea of the house prediction app is a micro house analyst that
returns the average amount needed to purchase a house in Nigeria depending on the 
area and number of bedrooms

##A walk down of how it was created

- Data Was first gotten from a Nigerian house sales website
- Data was cleaned and analized using python's pandas module
- Data was then converted to CSV
- Data was imported into a flask app 
- frontend using html and Boostrap was implemented
